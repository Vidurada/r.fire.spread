r.fire.spread
=============

GRASS GIS module for wildfire simulation wrapping r.ros and r.spread modules.

The code will be moved to GRASS GIS addons once the interface and functionality is stabilized.
Currently it is using list of maps on the input but it should probably accept temporal datasets.
Then the question is if only the datasets or also the lists.
